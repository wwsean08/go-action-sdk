# Go Action SDK (port of the google action java sdk)

## About
This is a port of a port.  Put simply my javascript experience and knowledge is minimal at best, however frogermcs ported the action sdk google released from javascript to java.  I know java and since I wanted to work in go to make containerization easier and smaller I have ported his work to Go which is my goto language currently.

This is currently under active development and is not ready.  I will merge it into the master branch when it is ready to be used/tested/broken.  That being said I do not guarantee any functionality or that it will be kept up to date if google changes their API.
